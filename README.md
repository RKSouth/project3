## Description

This app was created to make a fun, exciting battle game so users can pass time. A user begins by signing up with an email, username, and password. They are redirected ot a screen including a leaderboard and user information. At the bottom there is a button to guide the user to begin the game. Once the game begins the user is prompted to choose their champion! The CPU is chosen at random and the battle begins. Once either the user or the CPU reaches health of 0, then the game is over.

This game was inspired by Rock Paper Scissors, but made with 5 choice options instead of 3. 


## Complications

Some compllications faced in this application was saving user data once logged in.
